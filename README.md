A project for improving my JS skills.

This is the first project of the general JS course I'm doing. I wanted to speedrun 
backend development in JS but it seems I need to get my fundamentals down if I 
want to deal with API's and program server behaviour. So this will be one of 
my first big steps toward becoming a full stack developer, or at least someone
 who can contribute meaningfully to a team, whether that be on a general 
software project, a hackathon, or anything else. Let's start!
